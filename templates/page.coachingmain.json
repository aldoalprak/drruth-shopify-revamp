As a holistic health coach for humans, I already knew some of the material. Still, she blew me away with detailed but understandable information of the body systems and the foods and supplements to address insufficiencies that lead to disease for both dogs and cats. Her knowledge and teaching of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine is the perfect complement to address issues beyond what functional medicine teaches (also mind-blowing!). The information is presented thoughtfully, and, what I appreciate most, is Dr. Ruth’s personal time that she gives to each student, ensuring their understanding of the material and success in the program. If you are ready to improve your pet’s health – and possibly even your career – I highly recommend this program to both the engaged and motivated novice and the trained health professional!",
